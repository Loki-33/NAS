Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-06_23-44-45)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: d014101b66d89d8ea8bf9afc3d96bbafec0ac85fb8dd38e8dcd9dfa2) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 08000000d58dd99ae772cafae122665d5b324b67ad4ffc8ed0d9d0def7c2ddce, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=21191, memory used=0.17GB) was running was 6.87GB / 7.14GB (0.961452), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 23f240d8e203549bde49f80c0624d5a145368eaba4c59d2ca2700fbc) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-23f240d8e203549bde49f80c0624d5a145368eaba4c59d2ca2700fbc*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
