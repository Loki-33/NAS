Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-06_23-44-46)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: d014101b66d89d8ea8bf9afc3d96bbafec0ac85fb8dd38e8dcd9dfa2) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 07000000c89894eccef2cc26cd421fe25b081babdab11bb24832c76a15a318a8, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=21214, memory used=0.21GB) was running was 6.79GB / 7.14GB (0.950127), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 8904ea6494492a97b6cab4bc0b4494cacb2301cbb31b068e1f051ee0) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-8904ea6494492a97b6cab4bc0b4494cacb2301cbb31b068e1f051ee0*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
