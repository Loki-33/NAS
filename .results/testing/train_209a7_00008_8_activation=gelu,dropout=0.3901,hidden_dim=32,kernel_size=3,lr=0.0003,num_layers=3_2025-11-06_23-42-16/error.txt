Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-06_23-42-41)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: 570218d5abaf56db41cf41298c8537a95ae04ef630d41da0816d6253) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 080000005c4ad594d93aad1d4924eb0a3421f1a0f76a4145037ff7c9c393601e, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=18010, memory used=0.19GB) was running was 6.82GB / 7.14GB (0.954372), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: ec0140d289cf682c9898d363cadbc784933b9245edcc55f7f2bcdacc) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-ec0140d289cf682c9898d363cadbc784933b9245edcc55f7f2bcdacc*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
