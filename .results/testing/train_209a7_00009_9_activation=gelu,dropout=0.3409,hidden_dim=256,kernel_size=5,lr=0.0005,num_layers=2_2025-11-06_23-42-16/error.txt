Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-06_23-42-40)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: 570218d5abaf56db41cf41298c8537a95ae04ef630d41da0816d6253) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 09000000cf995ae5d15a843176b405413256e26630e1ecf82cc078eb361c2b70, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=18017, memory used=0.19GB) was running was 6.83GB / 7.14GB (0.956453), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 8d2b074fe1b490402ea9f8665e9193e19e1857ef3d6f3eab0fdb9b55) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-8d2b074fe1b490402ea9f8665e9193e19e1857ef3d6f3eab0fdb9b55*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
