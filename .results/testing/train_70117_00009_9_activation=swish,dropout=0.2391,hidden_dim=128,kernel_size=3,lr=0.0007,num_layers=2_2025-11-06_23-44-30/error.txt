Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-06_23-44-44)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: d014101b66d89d8ea8bf9afc3d96bbafec0ac85fb8dd38e8dcd9dfa2) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 090000005b2c61df3784e89ad0d6ec37b32bd4b329fd815c52653949bd735e21, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=21220, memory used=0.17GB) was running was 6.83GB / 7.14GB (0.956065), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 2bda12c2aac833ca6dd3bd50e26abfc853e95ba74c9d3902d3fe907d) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-2bda12c2aac833ca6dd3bd50e26abfc853e95ba74c9d3902d3fe907d*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
