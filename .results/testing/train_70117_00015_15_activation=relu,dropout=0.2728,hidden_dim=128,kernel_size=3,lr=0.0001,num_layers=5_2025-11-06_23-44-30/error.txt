Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-06_23-44-53)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: d014101b66d89d8ea8bf9afc3d96bbafec0ac85fb8dd38e8dcd9dfa2) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 0f0000005ed40767daf16337974822a85eed7bf60d42314aed4e5ced355a96a1, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=22166, memory used=0.17GB) was running was 6.80GB / 7.14GB (0.951698), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: d99cec2b6f63227531892908ed30f88fc3f7779edf7b4c0e15e511e3) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-d99cec2b6f63227531892908ed30f88fc3f7779edf7b4c0e15e511e3*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
