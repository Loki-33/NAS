Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-07_00-03-36)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: 0284ec166048956813630981cd3eac3c9f8f3816c01f2d0b94c29a54) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 09000000ee8acd4c9124071aaf04100d0be2e4d0466a0d8bf3d3d78eb62698ca, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=39742, memory used=0.19GB) was running was 6.80GB / 7.14GB (0.952117), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 9b4824cf208501f922ef6bd76011b764200545fe622b9fd9a650663b) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-9b4824cf208501f922ef6bd76011b764200545fe622b9fd9a650663b*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
