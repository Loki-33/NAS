Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-06_23-49-43)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: 4122b7c7922ee89839704e92b4e886134db2f19785140c19c3d9911e) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 07000000ddabb98e08726d1a87505307b5dd31ccb8fc5b304be0bc79384ae238, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=25050, memory used=0.21GB) was running was 6.82GB / 7.14GB (0.954757), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 0b6dd7d84b56846f9080beefb69e93ace0755cb3b7ede0542cc4bcd1) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-0b6dd7d84b56846f9080beefb69e93ace0755cb3b7ede0542cc4bcd1*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
