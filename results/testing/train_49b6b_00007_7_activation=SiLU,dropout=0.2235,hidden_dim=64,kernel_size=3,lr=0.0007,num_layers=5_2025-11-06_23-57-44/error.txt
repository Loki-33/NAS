Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-06_23-58-08)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: dd4d7f6b7059887058987bd5af30f57f460554ac3f58918a1bef0076) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 0700000082c58274b82c8666bdb5da8a0faa98cea1b5329d8c52390e160b92c7, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=32916, memory used=0.23GB) was running was 6.81GB / 7.14GB (0.953018), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 09768a6d943aa0fed990f3b2e5ea4927851416aa45620edff35f7926) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-09768a6d943aa0fed990f3b2e5ea4927851416aa45620edff35f7926*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
