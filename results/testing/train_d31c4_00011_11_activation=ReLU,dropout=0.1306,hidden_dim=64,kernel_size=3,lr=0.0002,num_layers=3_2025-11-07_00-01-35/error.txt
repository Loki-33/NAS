Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-07_00-01-50)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: 3a38534942cd5fd862b8289e0226b70eb92e9d71c5ce9772581fba99) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 0b0000006b74f5ba9dbb1805a34ee3bf8fa6902e68bc4684f22811f3f1b5d98a, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=36763, memory used=0.21GB) was running was 6.79GB / 7.14GB (0.95098), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 33be438be0814f413189292f3a8c57dd30fdeb5085e359bb825940d0) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-33be438be0814f413189292f3a8c57dd30fdeb5085e359bb825940d0*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
