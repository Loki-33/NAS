Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-07_00-03-42)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: 0284ec166048956813630981cd3eac3c9f8f3816c01f2d0b94c29a54) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 10000000f41c75d19df2da45fceec4949d48686cedda0faa1922bd36aab86666, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=40679, memory used=0.08GB) was running was 6.84GB / 7.14GB (0.957462), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 7c918ff944b1aadd70c036a333d0a4847dc7926ca47a61f7db3eb913) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-7c918ff944b1aadd70c036a333d0a4847dc7926ca47a61f7db3eb913*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
