Failure # 1 (occurred at 2025-11-06_23-54-48)
Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.
Memory on the node (IP: 10.144.151.105, ID: 1b7f78e51a87a77b1d1c05a4c328f127867e79d79040f23bbc103a51) where the lease (actor ID: NIL_IDlease ID: 0a00000029bfe611b93abe22bce83f5facf0cf11733efbd07588411796380cc8, name=ImplicitFunc.__init__, pid=29077, memory used=0.20GB) was running was 6.81GB / 7.14GB (0.954101), which exceeds the memory usage threshold of 0.95. Ray killed this worker (ID: 3bd89daff45f77d1f8e7605d8689dbc43d2308906c65e56543ba0b24) because it was the most recently scheduled task; to see more information about memory usage on this node, use `ray logs raylet.out -ip 10.144.151.105`. To see the logs of the worker, use `ray logs worker-3bd89daff45f77d1f8e7605d8689dbc43d2308906c65e56543ba0b24*out -ip 10.144.151.105. Top 10 memory users:

Refer to the documentation on how to address the out of memory issue: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html. Consider provisioning more memory on this node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. Set max_restarts and max_task_retries to enable retry when the task crashes due to OOM. To adjust the kill threshold, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_usage_threshold` when starting Ray. To disable worker killing, set the environment variable `RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms` to zero.
